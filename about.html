            Dani Berman is a 21 year-old dancer located in Manhattan, NY. Most recently she has been training in dance at Marymount Manhattan College, obtaining her BFA in Dance. She is currently in her senior year. Her dance focus of study is jazz and choreography, studying with industry professionals like Sheila Barker, Katie Heinin, and Geoffrey Doig Marx. During her time at MMC, Dani has studied techniques that include, but are not limited to, ballet, Graham, O'Donnell, Nikolais, Horton, commercial/theater jazz, afrobeat, hip-hop, body percussion, contemporary, tap, west african, Lindy Hop, and improv. She loves theater, and is training for a career in the theater world. Dani supplements her education with classes at Steps on Broadway, having studied with Joshua Bergasse, Dylan Pearce, and more. In her budding career thus far, Dani has been a part of works in both the theater and concert realm. She has been in pieces by Monique Smith, Jamal White, Dolly Sfeir, Tamisha Guy, and Raja Feather Kelly. She attended the Ascend Summer Intensive, and worked with Kele Roberson, Shanees D.

She has created multiple works for a band in Long Island called "Lipbomb" and has begun working on two more episodic works for her senior project. She is excited to practice her choreographic skills after college.
